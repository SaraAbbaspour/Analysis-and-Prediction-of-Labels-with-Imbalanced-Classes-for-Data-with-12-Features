# Prediction-of-Imbalanced-Classes
This repository houses Python code for the analysis and prediction of labels, including 9 imbalanced classes (0 to 8), for a dataset with 12 features (all continuous variables) and one target column (a categorical variable). The primary objective is to build a predictive model capable of accurately classifying each row based on the provided features.
